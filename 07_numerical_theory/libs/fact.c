 * Make prime factorization for an.
 *
 * Runtime Complexity: O(sqrt(n))
 *
 * Runtime complexity was reduced based on two main ideas:
 * 1. Only sqrt(n) numbers need to be checked, if n is divisible
 *    by a number > sqrt(n), it's co-factor needs to be smaller
 *    than sqrt(n) i.e. it has already been checked previously
 * 2. If n is odd, only odd numbers have to be checked
 * 3. If n is even, the number of even divisors (which is the
 *    number of times it can be divided by 2) can be counted
 *    in O(log n) steps.
 *
 * @param n the number to factorize
 * @param factors array that will be filled with the factors
 * @param n_factors will contain the number of factors
